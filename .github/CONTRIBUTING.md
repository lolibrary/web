### Pull Requests should try and be as focussed as possible.

You should try and keep your PRs as small as possible. It's hard to review something huge!

### Discussions and interactions should be in-line with our Code of Conduct

You may be banned from interacting with Lolibrary's repositories if you violate the code of conduct.
